# removing duplicate rows


# selecting a subset of a data.frame. 
# For example, let you want to extract non-domestic segment data from a data frame contaning all segment data.
# (the code 2 and 3 in geotp is used for domestic and non-domestic segments, respectively)
subset(segment, segment$geotp == 3)


# extracting some parts of a vector. 
# For example, suppose you have 4-digit SIC codes and you want to create a vector containing 2-digit codes
data$two.sic<- substr(data$four.digit, 1, 2)						


# converting from wide format to long format
library(tidyr)
export %>% pivot_longer( cols=paste("year", 1988:2020, sep=""), 
                         names_to='year',  
                         values_to='export share')


# creating a column in a data.frame containing the maximum value of two specific columns
data$maximum<- pmax(data$col1, data$col2)

# converting SAS date format 
# When you extract data from financial databases (like WRDS) in SAS file, the date's format is not in a common way (like dd-mm-yyyy).
# In this case, you may want to convert date format.


# removing missing values
# The common way to remove missing values from your data set is na.omit function. This function totaly removes rows with at least one missing value. 
na.omit(your data set's name)



# replacing missing values

# standardizing

# winsorizing
